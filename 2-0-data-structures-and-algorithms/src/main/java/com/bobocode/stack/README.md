Improve your data structures skills

### Task
**Stack** is a last in, first out (LIFO) collection of elements. Your job is to
implement the *todo* section of the class `LinkedStack`. Please note, that your implementation should be based on **singly
liked  nodes.** It means that you should create your own class `Node<T>` that will hold stack elements.

To verify your implementation, run `StackTest.java`

### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with Stack data structure, and be able to write Java code

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing `Stack` interface in `LinkedStack` class.
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the [exercise/completed](https://github.com/bobocode-projects/java-fundamentals-course/tree/exercise/completed) branch and see the final implementation
