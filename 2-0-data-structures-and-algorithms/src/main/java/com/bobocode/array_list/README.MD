Improve your basic knowledge about data structures and Java Core. 
This wrapper is a simple version of the `ArrayList` data structure. 
### Task
`ListOfLongs` interface provides an API with a couple of methods for a wrapper of a default array in Java. Your job is to implement the *todo* section of `ArrayListOfLongs` class. 
To verify your implementation, run `ListOfLongsTest.java`.
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with arrays, cycles, conditions, exceptions and variables.

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
