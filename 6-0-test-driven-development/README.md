The list of exercises dedicated to training your Test-driven development (TDD) skills 

### No pain, No gain :heavy_exclamation_mark:

> Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft

Working on real problems, you're focused on finding a solution. Learning new things, you're trying to understand how it works.
It is important to have a different type of activities, which purpose is improving your skill 

***An exercise** is a predefined task that you continuously implement to improve a certain skill* :muscle:

### The three laws of TDD
1. You should not write production code until you have written a failing unit test
2. You should not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail
3. You should not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the failing test
