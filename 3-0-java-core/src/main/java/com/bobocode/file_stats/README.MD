Improve your Java SE skills
### Task
`FileStats` is an API that allows you to get character statistics based on text file. Your job is to 
implement the *todo* section of that class. Please note, that each object should be immutable and should not allow to 
reload or refresh input data.
  
To verify your implementation, run `FileStatsTest.java`
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to know how to work with text files and be able to write Java code

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and create a branch **exercise/your_username** if you want your code to be reviewed
* Start implementing the **todo** section and verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
